## Usage

1. **Add a task** by typing into the textbox and pressing **Enter** or clicking **Add**.  
2. **Toggle completion** by clicking the checkbox next to an item.  
3. **Delete** selected tasks using the **Delete** button or right-click (if implemented).  
4. **Export** your list to Markdown via **File -> Export**.  
5. **Import** a `.md` file formatted like `- [ ] Task` or `- [x] Task` via **File -> Import** â€” new items (matching text) are skipped.
